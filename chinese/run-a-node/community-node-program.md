# Community Node Program

The Community Node program making it easy to join the [Amber Network](../pre-mainnet/amber-network-1/amber-network.md) as a Node Operator even if you're new to the network.

More info on the program below.

## Goal of the Program <a id="goal-of-the-program"></a>

The Oasis Foundation set up this program in order to give new teams an experience to run a node on the network, get involved in the broader Oasis Network community and earn a chance to get a delegation from the Foundation at Mainnet launch.

## How the Program Works <a id="how-the-program-works"></a>

The program is pretty simple:

1. [Set up your node and create a public key](set-up-your-node/running-a-node.md)
2. Submit your details [here](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/Z0w1W2)
3. The Oasis Foundation will provide a small token delegation and send you a notification when it’s done
4. [Register and run your node](set-up-your-node/running-a-node.md) \(skip instructions related to staking as you’ve been delegated funds by the Foundation\)
5. Join the `#nodeoperators` channel on [slack](https://oasisprotocol.org/slack) and get help from other nodes
6. [File issues](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-core/issues/new/choose) and help improve the Network

## Will I Earn Staking Rewards <a id="will-i-earn-staking-rewards"></a>

Please note that while the Foundation will provide a small delegation of tokens to kick start your node, it may not be enough to get into the consensus committee or earn staking rewards at first.

For Amber, the consensus committee size is currently set at 100 nodes.

For the time being, we hope this initial delegation will be enough to get started on the network, test it out, and see how it works from a technical perspective.
