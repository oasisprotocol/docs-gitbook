# Network Architecture Overview

As an operator of a Node on the Oasis Network, it is suggested that you have an understanding of the system architecture of the Oasis Network. Here we will provide a high level overview of the Oasis Network's architecture. This overview is used to provide enough guidance to be useful for the purposes of getting started as a Node Operator. Note that not all of these features are available in the Public Testnet, and their design may change in later phases. For more information on our proposed design, see [our research papers](https://oasisprotocol.org/researchpapers).

## Decentralized Consensus Layer <a id="decentralized-consensus-layer"></a>

The Oasis Network is based on a Proof-of-Stake \(PoS\) consensus model. Tokens can be self-delegated directly by each node operator or delegated to a node operator by other token holders. While the Oasis Network is designed with a modular architecture that can use any consensus system that satisfies these properties, it currently uses [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) as its consensus algorithm. To run a node yourself you can find information on operating a node on the Oasis Network [here](../run-a-node/set-up-your-node/running-a-node.md).

Participating in consensus is one of two critical ways that node operators can help run and be part of the network. Validators will be able to sign blocks, earn transaction fees, stake, and receive delegation. Similar to the PoS design implemented by Cosmos, up to 100 validators with the most stake can participate in the consensus process.

The system will disincentivize bad behavior via slashing for double-signing, as well as via the cost to dominate the network, in terms of the number of staked tokens.

A complete proposal of staking, delegation and the incentives that align to both on the consensus layer can be found [here](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-network-primer/token-metrics-and-distribution#staking-incentives).

## Oasis Network Parallel-Runtimes \(ParaTimes\) <a id="oasis-network-parallel-runtimes-paratimes"></a>

In addition to a decentralized Consensus Layer, Oasis will also allow for anyone to add their own runtime to the Network. The system was developed this way in order to achieve the highest degree of decentralization, while also separating consensus from execution — improving network throughput and scalability. In addition, supporting parallel runtimes allows for specialized support for different workloads. For example, confidential runtimes could mandate that nodes to use trusted execution environments, where as a non-confidential runtime would have less restrictive hardware requirements.

In this model, any runtime developer can use the open-sourced [Oasis Eth/WASI Runtime](https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis-ethwasi-runtime) or any other runtime they choose to use. The privacy and confidentiality technologies baked into the Oasis Eth/WASI Runtime allow it to support confidential smart contract transactions and the use to TEEs including Intel SGX and others, but can be used for non-confidential smart contracts as well.

Key highlights of the Oasis Network ParaTimes:

* **Who can manage a runtime:** Anyone. We welcome you to use the Oasis Eth/WASI Runtime code as a base, copy, or add your own existing runtime.
* **How can validators participate in these runtime:** Runtime developers will be able to specify conditions on the nodes to run compute for their runtime. Node operators can make themselves available to runtimes, or, if you’re a runtime developer looking for operators, you can find a list of potential partners on the Node Operator Leaderboards as a way to identify potential partners.
* **Paying for transactions:** In order to pay for consensus layer transactions, runtime developers will need to provide a deposit used \(1\) to reserve a spot on the network; and \(2\) as a drawdown mechanism to pay for consensus-layer transactions.

## An Example of ParaTime: Oasis Labs’ Data Sovereignty Runtime <a id="an-example-of-paratime-oasis-labs-data-sovereignty-runtime"></a>

While anyone can build a runtime and add it to the Oasis consensus layer at any time, we also expect that there will be a few up and running at the time of Mainnet launch as well.

For example, Oasis Labs plans to use the Oasis Network and the open-sourced Oasis Runtime in order to provide a confidential compute and storage layer for developers who plan to run confidential smart contracts on the Oasis Network. Through a [set of APIs and other confidentiality tooling](https://www.oasislabs.com/data-privacy), developers big and small will be able to take advantage of confidential computation and secure computing techniques while the blockchain technology is abstracted away.

Early use cases of this in action include developers in the genomics, hospital management, credit scoring, and financial services industries that Oasis Labs expects to provide organic transaction volume to the Oasis Network. No commit comments for this range

## Networking Protocols <a id="networking-protocols"></a>

The Oasis Network uses three different protocols for communication:

* [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint)
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
* [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p)

For more technical details feel free to look at the [Oasis Core developer documentation](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core).

## Entities and Key Management <a id="entities-and-key-management"></a>

Every Node that participates on the network is owned by a specific Entity. This Entity is not only a logical abstraction but is also a critical aspect of the key management model for node operators. The model is as follows:

* Entity
  * An Entity is an organization or individual with stake on the network
  * Each Entity's key pair is used for:
    * Registering Node IDs \(Node's Public Key\)
    * Token transfers
* Node
  * A Node is a block producing node on the Oasis Network
  * Each Node's key pair is used for:
    * Signing actions during block production

## Definitions <a id="definitions"></a>

### Entity <a id="entity"></a>

An Entity is an organization or individual with stake on the network. Each Entity has a private key that controls access to the wallet of the Entity.

### Node <a id="node"></a>

A Node is a device \(VM, Bare Metal, Container, etc.\) that is participating in a committee on the Network. Each Node has a private key that is used for signing operations during block production and a public key, or Node Identity, used for identification.

### Committee <a id="committee"></a>

A Committee is a set of Nodes that are participating in the same service layer of the Oasis Network.
