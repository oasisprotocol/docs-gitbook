# Overview

## What is the Oasis Network? <a id="what-is-the-oasis-network"></a>

The Oasis Network is a privacy-first decentralized computing network.

The Oasis Network separates consensus from computation, making the platform highly adaptable while enabling high-performance computation. This unique design has two major core components, the Consensus Layer and the ParaTime Layer.

* _The Consensus Layer_: The Consensus Layer is a decentralized set of validator nodes that maintains a proof-of-stake blockchain.
* _The ParaTime Layer_: The ParaTime Layer can host multiple parallel runtimes, each representing a replicated compute environment with shared state.

## Key Features <a id="key-features"></a>

**Confidentiality** The Oasis Network is designed to support end-to-end confidentiality and data ownership, with built-in support for key management and TEEs like Intel SGX — allowing it to support new privacy-preserving applications and services.

**Versatility & Resilience** The Oasis Network is designed to support a broad range of use cases without having to go through hard-forks or large updates — helping ensure it can retain its value and utility for many years to come.

**Performance** The Oasis Network separates computation from consensus and allows for ParaTimes to operate in parallel — avoiding throughput issues that have plagued other networks.

## FAQ <a id="faq"></a>

### Are you a proof-of-stake or proof-of-work platform? <a id="are-you-a-proof-of-stake-or-proof-of-work-platform"></a>

Oasis is a proof-of-stake platform.

Unlike many other proof of stake networks however, we have a different architectural design that separates compute from consensus and allows the system to scale to support transactions with greater complexity than many traditional sharding platforms.

### Is Oasis a unique platform or built on top of Ethereum? <a id="is-oasis-a-unique-platform-or-built-on-top-of-ethereum"></a>

Oasis is a unique Layer 1 platform and is not built on top of Ethereum.

To learn more about our platform read our [white paper](https://oasisprotocol.org/papers)!

### How does this compare to a private blockchain like Hyperledger? <a id="how-does-this-compare-to-a-private-blockchain-like-hyperledger"></a>

At Oasis our goal is to build a public decentralized network that offers additional properties of confidentiality and privacy for your data.

Conversely, Hyperledger is a siloed network typically run and owned by one entity that retains some of the properties often found in blockchain computing systems.

It does not support confidentiality across a public network.

### When will you open source your code? <a id="when-will-you-open-source-your-code"></a>

All code can be found at [https://github.com/oasisprotocol](https://github.com/oasisprotocol).

### How can I become a node operator or a validator on Oasis Network? <a id="how-can-i-become-a-node-operator-or-a-validator-on-oasis-network"></a>

The Oasis network is a proof of stake system and we’ll look to community members to run nodes for everything from storage to computation to consensus.
