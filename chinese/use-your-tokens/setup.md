# Setup

Make sure you have installed everything described in the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md) section.

## Server commands

To run a command that requires a connection to an online Oasis node \(i.e. the `server`\), you need to either:

* change the working directory to where the internal Oasis node UNIX socket is located \(e.g. `/serverdir/node/`\) before executing the command, or
* pass the `-a $ADDR` flag where `ADDR` represents the path to the internal Oasis node UNIX socket prefixed with `unix:` \(e.g.`unix:/serverdir/node/internal.sock`\).

Here are some examples of Oasis Node CLI commands that need a connection to an online Oasis node:

* `oasis-node stake info`: Shows general staking information.
* `oasis-node stake list`: Lists all accounts with positive balance.
* `oasis-node stake account info`: Shows detailed information for an account.
* `oasis-node consensus submit_tx`: Submits a pre-generated transaction to the network.

## Local commands

The following commands are intended to be run on your local machine and only need access to the network's current [Genesis File](../pre-mainnet/genesis-file.md) and your signer's private key:

* `oasis-node stake account gen_transfer`
* `oasis-node stake account gen_escrow`
* `oasis-node stake account gen_reclaim_escrow`
* `oasis-node stake account gen_amend_commission_schedule`

{% hint style="danger" %}
We strongly suggest that you do not use any entity/staking account that is generated with the file-based signer on the Mainnet.

In case you need to use the file-based signer, make sure you only use it on an [offline/air-gapped machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_%28networking%29). Gaining access to your entity's/staking account's private key can compromise your tokens.
{% endhint %}

## JSON pretty-printing

We will pipe the output of commands that return JSON through [Python's `json.tool` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json.tool) to pretty-print it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be aware that [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/), the popular JSON CLI tool, [converts all numbers to IEEE 754 64-bit values](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/FAQ#caveats) which can result in silent loss of precision and/or other changes.

Hence, we recommend avoiding its usage until this issue is resolved.

## Common CLI Flags

### Base Flags

All commands for generating and signing transactions need the following base flags set:

* `--genesis.file`: Path to the genesis file, e.g. `/localhostdir/genesis.json`. 



  For convenience, set the `GENESIS_FILE` environment value to its value, e.g.:

  ```bash
  GENESIS_FILE=/localhostdir/genesis.json
  ```

* `--signer.dir`: Path to entity's artifacts directory, e.g.  `entity-$LEDGER_INDEX`

  or `/localhostdir/entity/`

### Signer Flags

Currently, we provide two options for signing transactions:

* **Ledger-based signer.**

  You will need to set it up as described in our [Oasis Core Ledger](https://docs.oasis.dev/oasis-core-ledger/usage/transactions) docs.

* **File-based signer.**

  You will need to create your Entity as described in [Running a Node on the Network](../run-a-node/set-up-your-node/run-validator.md#creating-your-entity) docs and set the following flags:

  * `--signer.backend file`: Specifies use of the file signer.

### Storing Base and Signer flags in an Environment Variable

To make the transaction commands shorter and avoid typing errors, one can create an environment variable, e.g. `TX_FLAGS`, with all the [Base Flags](setup.md#base-flags) and [Signer Flags](setup.md#signer-flags) configured for his particular set up.

For example, one could set `TX_FLAGS` for a Ledger device like below \(make sure all `LEDGER_*` environment variables are set appropriately\):

```bash
TX_FLAGS=(--genesis.file $GENESIS_FILE
  --signer.dir entity-$LEDGER_INDEX
  --signer.backend plugin
  --signer.plugin.name ledger
  --signer.plugin.path "$LEDGER_SIGNER_PATH"
  --signer.plugin.config "wallet_id:$LEDGER_WALLET_ID,index:$LEDGER_INDEX"
)
```

Or, one could set `TX_FLAGS` like below to use a file signer:

```bash
TX_FLAGS=(--genesis.file $GENESIS_FILE
  --signer.backend file
  --signer.dir /localhostdir/entity/
)
```

### Common Transaction Flags

When generating a transaction, one needs to set the following transaction flags as appropriate for a given transaction:

* `--stake.amount`: Amount of base units to transfer, escrow, burn, etc.
* `--transaction.file`: Path to the file where to store the generated

  transaction.

* `--transaction.nonce`: Incremental number that must be unique for each account's transaction.

  To get your current account's nonce, see [Checking Your Account nonce](maintenance/checking-account-nonce.md) doc.

* `--transaction.fee.gas`: Maximum amount of gas \(in _gas units_\) a transaction can spend.  


  Gas costs for different staking transactions are specified by the `staking.params.gas_costs` consensus parameter.  


  To obtain its value from the genesis file, run:

  ```bash
  cat $GENESIS_FILE | \
    python3 -c 'import sys, json; \
    print(json.dumps(json.load(sys.stdin)["staking"]["params"]["gas_costs"], indent=4))'
  ```

* `--transaction.fee.amount`: Amount of base units we will pay as a fee for a transaction.

Note that specifying a transaction's fee amount \(via `--transaction.fee.amount`\) and maximum gas amount \(via `--transaction.fee.gas`\) implicitly defines the _gas price_ \(in base units\):

```text
gas_price = fee_amount / gas_amount
```

Gas price tells how much base units we are willing to pay for one gas unit.

Consensus validators can configure their own _minimum gas price_ \(via `consensus.tendermint.min_gas_price` configuration flag\) and will refuse to process transactions that have their gas price set below their minimum gas price.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, there is no mechanism to discover what minimum gas prices are used by validators.
