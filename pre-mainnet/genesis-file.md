# Genesis File Overview

The full genesis file is posted in the [Oasis Protocol Foundation's GitHub](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/tag/2020-09-22):

* [Genesis file](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/download/2020-09-22/genesis.json)
  * SHA1: `84b9b9df7fbb344192c8add9058b9494646da007`

We are sharing this information with the Oasis Network community to collect feedback and answer any questions that arise. Please fill out [this form](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/yG4pp57W) to share feedback and submit your questions regarding the Oasis Network’s genesis file. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the parameters and corresponding values in the genesis file are subject to change prior to the Oasis Network Mainnet launch. The information in this document applies to the upcoming Oasis Network Mainnet Dry Run. After a successful Mainnet Dry Run, we expect most of the parameters and corresponding values we have outlined in this document to carry over directly without any changes when we launch the Oasis Network Mainnet Beta \(transfers disabled\) and then Mainnet \(transfers enabled\). We welcome any and all feedback from the community as we craft a genesis file that provides a strong foundation for the long-term success of our network.

## What is a Genesis File?

A genesis file is a JSON document which contains a set of parameters that outline the initial state of a blockchain.

The state defined in the Oasis Network’s genesis file contains all of the necessary information for launching the Oasis Network Mainnet, including initial token allocations, network parameters, and more.

We will discuss some of the key parameters in the genesis file this document. You can view all of the parameters in the full genesis file in its raw form [here](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/download/2020-09-22/genesis.json).

## Genesis Time and Chain ID

The **genesis\_time** parameter is a UTC timestamp that specifies when the blockchain is officially going to launch. At the time of genesis, validators are expected to come online and start participating in the consensus process for operating the network. The network will start once validators representing more than 2/3 of stake in the initial consensus committee are online.

The **chain\_id** is a unique identifier for a blockchain. It also helps differentiate between different networks using the same version of the software.

For the Mainnet Dry Run:

* genesis\_time: "2020-09-22T16:00:00.000000000Z"
* chain\_id: "mainnet-dryrun-2020-09-22-1600790400"

## Epoch Time

The **interval** parameter specifies the number of blocks in an _epoch_. Epochs are used as a measure of time for staking reward schedules, debonding intervals, non-Mainnet test network expiration periods, and more. This value is set to 600, indicating that a new epoch on the Oasis Network transpires each time 600 new blocks are generated.

## Node Operator Registry

Within the **registry** object, there are a broad range of parameters that specify the initial set of node operators and their corresponding initial node statuses.

* **max\_node\_expiration** - The maximum duration \(in epochs\) that node registrations last. The starting value is set to 2 in order to ensure that a node is continuously online, since the node’s registration would expire each time 2 epochs pass, requiring the node to re-register.
* **entities** - The entity registrations for initial node operators, including public key and signature information. The values here were obtained during the entity package collection process that took place during early September.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are an operator who successfully completed the KYC process and submitted your entity package by the deadline in early September, your entity should be included in the genesis file. Please review the entities section of the genesis file [here](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/download/2020-09-22/genesis.json) to make sure that your entity is included in the genesis file if you were expecting it to be included. You can search for your entity in the genesis file using the entity public key from the entity package you submitted. If you encounter any issues with finding your entity, please let us know via the genesis file [feedback form](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/yG4pp57W).
{% endhint %}

* **nodes** - The node registrations for initial node operators, including public key and signature information.

## Gas Costs

The following parameters define the gas costs for various types of transactions on the network: 

* **compute\_commit** - The cost for a compute commit for a ParaTime node. The value is set to 10000 gas.
* **merge\_commit** - The cost for a ParaTime merge commit. The value is set to 10000 gas.
* **add\_escrow** - The cost for an add\_escrow \(staking\) transaction. The value is set to 1000 gas.
* **burn** - The cost for a burn transaction. The value is set to 1000 gas.
* **reclaim\_escrow** - The cost for a reclaim\_escrow transaction \(for withdrawing staked tokens\). The value is set to 1000 gas.
* **transfer** - The cost for a transfer transaction \(for sending tokens\). The value is set to 1000 gas.
* **amend\_commission\_schedule** - The cost for amending, or changing, a commission schedule. The value is set to 1000 gas.

## Node & Runtime Token Thresholds

There are several **threshold** parameters that specify the minimum number of tokens that need to be staked in order for a particular entity or a particular type of node to participate in the network. The minimum threshold specified for the **entity,** **node-compute, node-keymanager, node-storage,** and **node-validator** parameters is set to 100000000000 nanoROSE for each, indicating that you need to stake at least 100 ROSE tokens in order to have your entity or any of the specified nodes go live on the network. 

There are also minimum thresholds for registering new runtimes. The minimum thresholds for registering **runtime-compute** and **runtime-keymanager** are set to 50000000000000 nanoROSE, indicating that you need to stake at least 50000 ROSE tokens in order to register a runtime.

## Staking & Rewards

These key parameters are related to staking and rewards on the network:

* **debonding\_interval** - The period of time \(in epochs\) that must pass before staked or delegated tokens that are requested to be withdrawn are returned to the account's general balance. The value is set to 336 epochs, which is expected to be approximately 14 days.
* **reward\_schedule** - The staking reward schedule, indicating how the staking reward rate changes over time, defined at an epoch-by-epoch granular basis. The reward schedule uses a tapering formula with higher rewards being paid out at earlier epochs and then gradually decreasing over time.
* **signing\_reward\_threshold\_numerator** and **signing\_reward\_threshold\_denominator** - These parameters define the proportion of blocks that a validator must sign during each epoch to receive staking rewards. A proportion of 3/4 means that a validator must maintain an uptime of at least 75% during an epoch in order to receive staking rewards for that period.
* **rate\_change\_interval** - The granularity at which at rate changes can be specified in a commission schedule. This limits the complexity of the commission schedule; the value is set to 1, indicating that the commission rate can change once per epoch.
* **rate\_bound\_lead** - The minimum lead time \(in epochs\) needed for changes to commission rate bounds. Operators need to wait before any rate bound changes go into effect. The value is set to 336, which is expected to be approximately 14 days. 
* **max\_rate\_steps** - The maximum allowed number of rate step changes in a commission schedule.The value is set to 10, indicating that the commission schedule can have a maximum of 10 rate steps.
* **max\_bound\_steps** - The maximum allowed number of commission rate bound step changes in the commission schedule. The value is set to 10, indicating that the commission schedule can have a maximum of 10 bound steps.
* **min\_delegation** - The minimum amount of tokens required in a delegation. The value is set to 100000000000 nanoROSE, or 100 ROSE tokens.
* **fee\_split\_weight\_propose** - The block proposer's share of transaction fees, set to a value of 2.
* **fee\_split\_weight\_next\_propose** - The next proposer's share of transaction fees, set to a value of 1.
* **fee\_split\_weight\_vote** - A signer’s/voter’s share of transaction fees, set to a value of 1.
* **reward\_factor\_epoch\_signed** - The factor for rewards distributed to validators who signed at least threshold blocks in a given epoch, set to a value of 1. 
* **reward\_factor\_block\_proposed** - The factor for rewards earned for block proposal. Set to 0, indicating validators get no extra staking rewards for proposing block.

## Token Supply & Ledger

The following parameters specify the total token supply, total token pool reserved for staking rewards, and account balances across the network at the time of genesis: 

* **total\_supply** - Specifies the total token supply for the network, which is fixed at 10 billion ROSE tokens.
* **common\_pool** - The tokens reserved for staking rewards to be paid out over time.
* **ledger** - The staking ledger, encoding all accounts and corresponding account balances on the network at the time of genesis, including accounts for initial operators, backers, custodial wallets, etc.
* **delegations** - The encoding of the initial delegations at the time of genesis.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are an operator who successfully completed the KYC process and submitted your entity package by the deadline in early September, your account should be included in the genesis file, with an account general balance and escrow amount reflecting any grants, rewards, and Amber Network delegations you have received leading up to Mainnet. Please review the ledger section of the genesis file [here](https://github.com/oasisprotocol/mainnet-artifacts/releases/download/2020-09-22/genesis.json) to make sure that your account is included in the genesis file if you were expecting it to be included. Keep in mind that token balances are enumerated in nanoROSE, with 1 billion nanoROSE being equivalent to 1 ROSE token. You can search for account node in the ledger section of the genesis file by searching for your staking address, which is a Bech32-encoded address with the prefix "oasis". If you encounter any issues with finding your account in the ledger, please let us know via the genesis file [feedback form](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/yG4pp57W).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Interpreting your account balance in the ledger:** Your **general** balance includes all of your tokens that have not been staked or delegated. This will be set to 100 tokens at genesis to cover gas, as most of your tokens \(except that general balance of 100 tokens\) will initially be staked \(i.e. self-delegated\) on your behalf. Within the **escrow** field, your **active** parameter shows the total tokens that have been allocated or delegated to you.
{% endhint %}

### Ad-hoc Token Q&A

> What are the rate steps and bound steps in a commission schedule?

Operators can set any commission rate, but as a service to delegators, they must specify a range two weeks in advance and have their commission rate stay within that range.
That range is defined by the upper and lower bounds.
In the Oasis Network, operators publish these bounds on-chain, and it's listed as part of their entity's account.

Because operators have to specify the range two weeks in advance, they can only change their commission rate bounds at least two weeks from now at the earliest. So when an operator does this, it tells the network to change its commission rate bounds some time in the future.
The network understands that the bounds will change over time, and it represents this as a sequence of "bound steps."
Each bound step specifies an epoch time when the step goes into effect and the upper and lower bound.

Operators can change their commission rate for the next epoch or for an epoch farther in the future.
(The latter is necessary if a rate would become invalid at a bound change.)
The network also represents this as a sequence of steps, called the "rate steps."
Each rate step specifies an epoch time when the step goes into effect and the commission rate.

> What are the balance and total shares in an escrow account?
> Why have both when they're set to the same?

The escrow accounts are "pools," which track the combination of contributions from multiple sources.
A pool tracks the proportion of the total token balance that belongs to each contributor using numbers of "shares."
Initially, a pool will have the same number of shares as nanoROSE of the token balance.
However, the network tracks the two quantities separately because it sometimes adjusts the token balance without changing contributors' proportions.
For example, if a node gets slashed, its entity's escrow pools lose tokens, but the total shares and each delegator's shares stay the same.
Similarly, the non-commission part of a staking reward increases an entity's escrow pools' token balance without changing the shares.

We've built the software so that a genesis file can also represent states after slashing and staking rewards have been applied (we currently use this to transfer state across upgrades), so it expects both fields to be present.

> What are the initial commission rates and bounds?

For all operator accounts, the commission rate is 5%, and the initial commission rate bounds are 0%-20%.

> What if I want to set a different commission rate?

We won't be setting custom initial commission rates in our proposed genesis file.
After the network starts, to set your commission rate higher than the initial bounds included in the genesis file, use an "amend commission schedule" transaction to change your commission rate bounds at least 336 epochs in the future and include a change to the commission rate when that bound change would take effect.
See the [stake management instructions](https://docs.oasis.dev/general/run-a-node/set-up-your-node/stake-management#amending-a-commission-schedule) for how to generate and send this transaction.

> Regarding the criteria for the Foundation delegation from the Amber network reward, how can we check what the median commission rate is?

We are not certain that the official median commission rate shall be available.

> For The Quest winners, where in this genesis file are my reward tokens?

We've split it between a small general balance of 100 ROSE and put the rest into a self-delegation.
The amount in the self-delegation is not included in your account's general balance.
It's listed in the `.staking.delegations` section of the proposed genesis file.
This section is structured as a map of maps, with the outer key representing the operator's entity address and the inner key representing the delegator's address.
Each entry specifies a number of shares in that operator's entity's active escrow pool.
In the proposed genesis file, all escrow pools are initialized to have one share worth one nanoROSE.

## Slashing 

These parameters specify key values for the network's slashing mechanism:

* **amount** - The amount of tokens to slash for double signing. The value is set to 100000000000 nanoROSE, or 100 ROSE tokens.
* **freeze\_interval** - The duration, in epochs, for which a node that has been slashed for double signing is “frozen,” or barred from participating in the network's consensus committee. A value of 18446744073709551615 \(the maximum value for a 64-bit unsigned integer\) means that any node slashed for double signing is, in effect, permanently banned from the network.

## Consensus 

The following parameters are used to define key values for the network's consensus protocol:

* **min\_validators** - The minimum size for the consensus committee, set to 15 validators.
* **max\_validators** - The maximum size for consensus committee, set to 80 validators.
* **max\_validators\_per\_entity** - The maximum number of nodes from a given entity that can be in the consensus committee at any time. Set to a value of 1.
* **backend** - Defines the backend consensus protocol. Specified as "tendermint".
* **timeout\_commit** - Specifies long to wait after committing a block before starting a new block height, in nanoseconds \(this affects block interval\). Set to 5000000000 nanoseconds, or 5 seconds.
* **max\_tx\_size** - Maximum size for consensus-layer transactions, in bytes, set to 32768 bytes.
* **max\_block\_size** - Maximum block size, in bytes, set to 22020096 bytes
* **max\_block\_gas** - Maximum block gas, set to 0, which specifies an unlimited amount of gas. 
* **public\_key\_blacklist** - A list of the public keys that cannot be used on the network.

## Transfers

Please note that transfers will be disabled for Mainnet Beta and we expect once proposed by the community and adopted enabled to begin Mainnet. Transfers are enabled on Mainnet Dry Run to test this feature out completely.

## Feedback

We look forward to receiving the community’s feedback on the Oasis Network’s genesis file! If you have any specific feedback or questions, please let us know via the genesis file [feedback form](https://oasisfoundation.typeform.com/to/yG4pp57W).
