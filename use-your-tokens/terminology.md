# Terminology

## Delegation

You can _delegate_ your tokens by submitting an _escrow_ transaction that deposits a specific number of tokens into someone elseâ€™s escrow account \(as opposed to _staking_ tokens, which usually refers to depositing tokens into your own escrow account\).

In other words, delegating your tokens is equivalent to staking your tokens in someone else's node. Delegating your tokens can give you the opportunity to participate in the Oasis Network's proof-of-stake consensus system and earn rewards via someone else's node.
